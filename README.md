## Introduction

This project automates the provisioning and deployment of AWS infrastructure using Terraform. The infrastructure can include:

- AWS EC2 for compute instances.
- AWS RDS for database management.
- AWS S3 for storage.
- AWS VPC for network segmentation.
- AWS IAM for access control.
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk for application deployment.
- AWS MQ for messaging.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- An AWS account with appropriate permissions.
- Terraform installed on your local machine.
- AWS CLI configured with your AWS credentials.
- SSH key pair for accessing EC2 instances.

### Tools and Technologies

- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool used for provisioning the AWS resources.
- **AWS EC2**: Compute instances for application servers.
- **AWS RDS**: Managed relational database service.
- **AWS S3**: Scalable storage service.
- **AWS VPC**: Virtual Private Cloud for network isolation.
- **AWS IAM**: Identity and Access Management for security.
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Managed service for deploying and scaling web applications.
- **AWS MQ**: Managed message broker service.

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Terraform_repo.git
cd Terraform_repo
```

### Step 2: Configure AWS CLI

Ensure your AWS CLI is configured with the necessary credentials:

```sh
aws configure
```

### Step 3: Initialize Terraform

Initialize the Terraform working directory:

```sh
terraform init
```

## Usage

### Step 1: Customize Variables

Update the `variables.tf` file with your specific values, such as:

- AWS region
- VPC ID
- Subnet IDs
- Security group IDs
- Key pair name
- S3 bucket names

### Step 2: Plan the Deployment

Generate and review the execution plan:

```sh
terraform plan
```

### Step 3: Apply the Configuration

Apply the Terraform configuration to provision the resources:

```sh
terraform apply
```

### Step 4: Verify the Deployment

Verify that all resources have been provisioned correctly by checking the AWS Management Console.

## Configuration

### Variables

This repository uses a `variables.tf` file to manage input variables. Key variables include:

- `aws_region`: The AWS region to deploy resources.
- `vpc_id`: The ID of the VPC.
- `public_subnets`: List of public subnet IDs.
- `private_subnets`: List of private subnet IDs.
- `instance_type`: The EC2 instance type.
- `key_name`: The name of the SSH key pair.
- `db_username`: The database username.
- `db_password`: The database password.

### Sensitive Information

Sensitive information such as database passwords and API keys should be stored in environment variables or a secrets management tool rather than hardcoded in the Terraform files.

## Modules

### VPC Module

Manages the VPC, subnets, and associated networking components.

### EC2 Module

Handles the provisioning of EC2 instances.

### RDS Module

Manages the setup of the RDS database.

### S3 Module

Manages S3 buckets and related configurations.

### IAM Module

Handles the creation and management of IAM roles, policies, and users.

### Elastic Beanstalk Module

Automates the deployment of the Elastic Beanstalk environment.

### MQ Module

Manages AWS MQ for messaging.

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple EC2 Deployment

A basic example of deploying EC2 instances with minimal configuration.

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source = "./modules/vpc"
  ...
}

module "ec2" {
  source = "./modules/ec2"
  ...
}
```

### Example 2: Advanced Configuration

A more complex example with custom IAM roles, policies, and additional security configurations.

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source = "./modules/vpc"
  ...
}

module "ec2" {
  source = "./modules/ec2"
  ...
}

resource "aws_iam_role" "example" {
  ...
}
```

## Testing

### Step 1: Validate Terraform Files

Validate the syntax of the Terraform files:

```sh
terraform validate
```

### Step 2: Run Terraform Plan

Generate the execution plan to ensure there are no errors:

```sh
terraform plan
```

### Step 3: Apply in a Sandbox Environment

Deploy the configuration in a non-production environment to test.

## Deployment

### Step 1: Production Deployment

Once tested, apply the configuration to the production environment:

```sh
terraform apply -var 'environment=prod'
```

### Step 2: Monitoring

Monitor the resources and application using AWS CloudWatch and other relevant AWS monitoring services.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Error: Subnet not found**: Ensure the subnet IDs are correct and exist in your VPC.
- **Permission Denied**: Verify IAM roles and policies have the necessary permissions.

### Logs

Check the logs in AWS services such as CloudWatch, Elastic Beanstalk, and RDS for detailed error messages.
